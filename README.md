# Pathfinding Starter Code
1. The Random player shall have a randomly assigned path which begins with the start node, ends with the exit node, and hits the target along the path. The path shall be a valid traversal such that each sequential pair of nodes in the path are connected by an edge. This path will never contain the start and will only hit the end when it is at the end of the path.

2. Each player should have a statistic that tells how many edges they have traveled. This statistic should update each time they reach the end of an edge. This statistic should be shown for each player under the other statistics associated with them.
